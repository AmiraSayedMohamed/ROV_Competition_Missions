# In THis Task Measuring the Length of the ShipWreck and Identify Types

### Type of the ShipWreck

they have no mention that identifing the type will be automatic using computer vision so it will be Manual when you See the ShipWrech with Your Eyes Identify the types


### Measure the Length of the ShipWreck

in this mission you can measure the lenght by taking a reference of an object, and measure the referenec again first and press "s" from keyboard to consider it as a reference and then when you measure new object again by putting two point of the object you want to measure he will multiply this measurement by a ratio Ùˆ this ratio , will calculate Automatically in the code provided in this repositery using the reference image actual lenght and measurend lengh of the reference image again in competion , so this raio will multiplied with the new measurement  , but the code providen in this repostery , i have calibrate the camera from 46 cm distance from the camera , but there is a problem you when you take a measurement and measure the reference object , you should make your ROV Fixed to measure the other new object

and also another problem i have calibrate the camera from a distance 46 from this camera , so you have two options to solve this camera
- calibrate your camera from a distance by counting the number of tile and stop the rov on that tile , and calibrate your camera on that distance .
- The other solution is to measure the depth from the object and the camera and calbraite your camera on the depth what you want , and this is the best solution , so when your ROV go from any distance you can measure the lenght correctly becaurse you alreadey have the depth and based on that the measurement of the lenght will be obtained :

### models so that you can measure the depth
- depth any thing
- midas
- Depth Pro
- Marigold-E2E
- Metric3D v2

- There is also a depth sensor where you can measure the distance between the camera and the measured object:
you can find it in the provdied link:
